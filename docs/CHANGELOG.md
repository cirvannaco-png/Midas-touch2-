# Changelog

## v2.20 — Cross-asset Volume Profile Intelligence

### Added
- Trade-by-price volume profiling from `COPY_TICKS_TRADE` when the connected feed exposes trade ticks, with explicit provenance for real trade ticks, broker trade ticks, real-volume bars, and tick-volume bars.
- Real-volume retention in the canonical candle model so exchange-listed futures, stocks, ETFs, and indices can use `MqlRates.real_volume` when tick-level trade data is unavailable.
- Value Area state detection for acceptance above/below VAH/VAL and rejection back through those boundaries.
- POC migration telemetry, source-quality telemetry, and a revised Value Area score that distinguishes fair-value location, discount/premium distance, and accepted breakouts.
- A default contradiction-based hard gate: low-quality profiles fail open, accepted breakouts remain eligible, and only strong profile evidence against the trade thesis blocks the setup.

### Asset coverage
The Volume Profile layer is symbol-agnostic. Exchange-traded instruments can use exchange-provided trade/real volume where the broker feed exposes it; FX, OTC, and CFD symbols use the strongest broker-provided volume source available and remain explicitly marked as such. This prevents Midas from pretending that fragmented OTC volume is a single consolidated exchange tape.

### Validation boundary
The change is implemented on `feature/volume-profile-intelligence`. MetaEditor compilation and MT5 Strategy Tester/backtest results are still authoritative external gates and have not been claimed as passed by this repository-only integration.

## Research analytics — feature attribution, counterfactuals, scale-out, and OOS validation

### Added
- Research-only permutation feature importance and correlated-feature clustered MDA.
- Paired counterfactual replay analysis that rejects unpaired historical subsets.
- Replay-based scale-out policy value analysis covering expectancy, drawdown, MFE/MAE, holding time, costs, and paired deltas.
- A fail-closed research validation gate requiring locked-OOS evidence and consistent walk-forward folds, plus feature/cluster/counterfactual evidence and exit-policy replay evidence for exit-affecting changes.
- Architecture documentation at docs/RESEARCH_ANALYTICS_ARCHITECTURE.md.
- Dedicated unit coverage for all new research modules.

### Boundary
These additions do not modify live EA scoring, strategy routing, risk, portfolio, MultiTrade/Dual Trade, execution, or reconciliation logic. Research results remain evidence for promotion review and are not live weights.

## v2.18 — G6: broker-side safety checks + first tests for tools/

Two unrelated real gaps found by audit, fixed together since both were
flagged in the same pass.

### Fixed (G6, blocking)
Grepping `EA/includes/{Execution,Portfolio,Trading}` turned up
magic-number order attribution but ZERO checks for broker stop-distance/
freeze-level validation or connection-loss/market-closed handling —
both mandatory for a live-trading EA. Before this, the only defense
against any of the three was reacting to whatever retcode the broker
sent back AFTER a doomed request round-trip; nothing ever stopped one
from being sent in the first place.
- **`Execution/BrokerAdapter.mqh`** — three new checks, run before every
  broker call:
  - `IsConnected()` — `TERMINAL_CONNECTED`, checked once up front rather
    than folded into the retry loop (a retry loop spinning for a few
    hundred ms within one tick can't fix a genuinely dead connection).
  - `IsMarketOpenForTrading()` — `SYMBOL_TRADE_MODE_DISABLED` blocks
    everything including closes; `SYMBOL_TRADE_MODE_CLOSEONLY` blocks
    new opens only (closes/modifies still permitted).
  - `ValidateStopDistance()` — `SYMBOL_TRADE_STOPS_LEVEL` and
    `SYMBOL_TRADE_FREEZE_LEVEL` (whichever is larger; either can
    independently cause a broker rejection), plus a same-side sanity
    check (SL on the losing side, TP on the winning side) that catches
    a wiring bug elsewhere before it reaches the broker as a confusing
    generic rejection.
  Wired into `MarketBuy`/`MarketSell`/`PlaceLimit` (pre-send) and
  `ModifySLTP` (pre-modify — this is where `FREEZE_LEVEL` bites hardest
  in practice: a break-even/trailing move rejected because price sits
  inside the freeze zone). `ClosePartial`/`CloseFull` get the connection
  + close-only-vs-disabled check but not stop-distance (not applicable
  to a close). `m_lastLatencyUs` explicitly zeroed on every early
  refusal so `LastLatencyMs()` (v2.16) can't misleadingly report a
  previous call's latency for a request that never reached the broker.
  Every existing caller (`OrderManager`, `PositionManager`) already
  guards these calls with `if(...)`, so a new local refusal behaves
  exactly like an existing broker rejection from the caller's
  perspective — no control-flow changes needed there.

### Added
- **`tools/tests/`** (new) — first dedicated tests for `walk_forward.py`,
  `metrics_engine.py`, and `gating.py`, all of which had zero coverage.
  40 tests, all passing (`cd tools && python -m pytest`):
  - `test_stats.py` (14) — the shared CI math these three tools all
    build on: empty samples, single-class AUC, n<4 Pearson, zero
    variance, overlap/direction edge cases.
  - `test_gating.py` (10) — `_validate_cycles()`'s three raise
    conditions (empty history, mixed live/synthetic, missing
    source/cycle_id tags) and `decide()`'s four actions
    (`INSUFFICIENT_DATA`/`HOLD`/`PROMOTE`/`ROLLBACK`), including the
    contradiction case specifically (must `ROLLBACK`, never average
    itself into a `HOLD`).
  - `test_metrics_engine.py` (9) — no_fill/ambiguous correctly excluded
    from expectancy but not coverage, directional bias, decile bucket
    boundaries, and `compute_regime_matrix()`'s profit-factor/
    max-drawdown arithmetic checked against a hand-computed 5-trade
    sequence.
  - `test_walk_forward.py` (7) — `split_train_holdout()`'s window
    boundary placement, all three `compute_walk_forward_report()`
    verdicts (`insufficient_data`/`consistent`/`diverged`), and that
    `ingest_tester_csv()` fails as a documented `NotImplementedError`
    stub rather than silently.
  `conftest.py` sets the same env vars `telegram-bridge/tests/conftest.py`
  does (needed before `app.config.Settings()` — a module-level
  singleton — is first constructed by `metrics_engine`/`walk_forward`'s
  imports) and provides a `FakeOutcome` dataclass + `make_outcome`
  fixture standing in for `app.models.SignalOutcome` — none of the
  functions under test touch the database, they only do attribute
  access on whatever rows they're handed, so a real ORM instance (which
  would need a live session to construct) buys nothing.
- New `tools/pytest.ini`, same shape as `telegram-bridge/pytest.ini`.

### Explicitly not done here
`telegram-bridge/tests/` untouched — confirmed via `git diff --stat` on
that directory (empty). Installed `pytest`, `sqlalchemy[asyncio]`,
`aiosqlite`, `pydantic-settings` in this environment only to actually
run the new suite (all 40 pass) rather than author it blind — same
discipline as running `tools/validate_mql5.py` on every MQL5 change.
`fastapi` was not installed, so the bridge's own suite was not re-run
here; it wasn't touched, so there was nothing to verify against it.

## v2.17 — Key-Level Reaction: the three sources v2.14 left unwired

Previous week high/low, session high/low, and psychological (round-number)
levels — the exact three the v2.14 header flagged as "None of the three
exist anywhere in the codebase yet." Built as their own pass, same
discipline v2.14 itself argued for.

### Added
- **`SmartMoney/ExtendedKeyLevels.mqh`** (new file) — `CExtendedKeyLevels`:
  - `NearestPrevWeekLevel()`: most recently CLOSED W1 bar's high/low
    (`iHigh`/`iLow(..., PERIOD_W1, 1)`), cached and only recomputed on
    week rollover. Checks both the high and the low as candidates and
    keeps whichever is nearer and on the requested side — a broken
    previous-week high can act as support just as readily as the low
    can, same "either side can flip role" treatment `FindNearestLevel()`
    already gives SR zones.
  - `NearestSessionLevel()`: current session's high/low so far, scanning
    closed bars on the same chart-TF candle series every other source
    uses, bounded by a new `CSessionFilter::CurrentSessionStartGMT()`
    (reuses the exact DST-aware start-hour math `CurrentSession()`
    already had — the two can't disagree about where a boundary sits).
    Returns false during `SESSION_DEAD` or before any closed bar has
    printed since the session opened.
  - `NearestRoundLevel()`: nearest round-number level at a configurable
    price-unit spacing (`InpKeyLevelRoundStep`, default 10.0 — whole-$10
    XAUUSD levels; a price-unit step, not a generic pip count, since
    this EA is single-symbol).
- **`Core/SessionFilter.mqh`** — `CurrentSessionStartGMT()`.
- Three new `ENUM_KEYLEVEL_SOURCE` values: `LEVEL_PREV_WEEK`,
  `LEVEL_SESSION`, `LEVEL_PSYCHOLOGICAL`.
- **`Strategies/KeyLevelReaction.mqh`** — `CKeyLevelEngine::Init()` takes
  two new optional (default `NULL`) pointers, `CExtendedKeyLevels*` and
  `CSessionFilter*`, so any existing call site not yet updated keeps
  compiling exactly as before. `FindNearestLevel()` folds the three new
  sources into the same nearest-wins, no-source-favorites comparison
  every existing source already participates in.
- **`Analysis/Scoring.mqh`** — owns the new `CExtendedKeyLevels` member,
  wires it (with the chart-TF symbol and the existing `m_sessionFilter`)
  into `m_keyLevelEngine.Init()`, and passes `InpKeyLevelRoundStep`
  through `ConfigureKeyLevelDiagnostics()`.
- **`Core/SignalLogger.mqh`** — `KeyLevelSourceLabel()` gained the three
  new cases. Without this fix the three new sources would have silently
  logged as `"None"` in the CSV even when a level was found and acted
  on — caught by grepping every other reference to the enum, not by a
  compiler, since MQL5 doesn't require exhaustive `switch` coverage.
- New input: `InpKeyLevelRoundStep` (default 10.0).

### Explicitly not done here
No change to `LEVEL_LIQUIDITY_POOL`'s existing "previous DAY high/low"
role — the new `LEVEL_PREV_WEEK` is additive, a different timeframe of
the same concept, not a replacement.

## v2.16 — Execution latency: measurement + fail-fast retries

Confirmation/execution is fully autonomous (no human-in-the-loop
Telegram gate) — `TS_DETECTED -> TS_VALIDATED -> TS_PENDING -> TS_FILLED`
all happen inside one `COrderManager::Submit()` call. Latency here means
that internal path, not a network round-trip to the bridge. Two gaps
made it both unmeasurable and needlessly slow:

### Added
- **`Execution/TradeStateMachine.mqh`** — microsecond-precision stage
  timestamps (`GetMicrosecondCount()`) captured in `Transition()`
  alongside the existing second-resolution `m_lastChange`, for the four
  states on the latency path only (`TS_DETECTED`/`TS_VALIDATED`/
  `TS_PENDING`/`TS_FILLED`). Four new accessors: `ConfirmationLatencyMs()`
  (DETECTED->VALIDATED), `SubmitLatencyMs()` (VALIDATED->PENDING),
  `ExecutionLatencyMs()` (PENDING->FILLED, the broker round-trip),
  `TotalLatencyMs()` (DETECTED->FILLED). Each returns -1.0 if its stages
  haven't both happened yet, rather than a misleading 0.0 or an
  underflowed subtraction of an unset timestamp. `ForceState()`
  (Recovery) deliberately does NOT stamp — a restored trade didn't just
  pass through that state, so a timestamp there would be fiction.
- **`Execution/BrokerAdapter.mqh`** — retry loops in `MarketBuy`/
  `MarketSell`/`PlaceLimit` now classify the retcode on every failed
  attempt via `IsRetryable()` instead of always sleeping the full
  `m_retryDelayMs` and burning all `m_maxRetries`: terminal rejections
  (invalid stops, no money, trade disabled, market closed, and similar)
  break immediately with zero further delay, since no amount of
  retrying changes them. Transient ones (requote, price changed, off
  quotes) retry at a capped ~50ms via `DelayForRetcode()` instead of the
  full configured delay, since they just need a fresh quote. Everything
  else keeps the original delay. New `LastLatencyMs()` exposes wall time
  spent in the most recently completed call, retries included.
- **`Monitoring/ProductionMonitor.mqh`** — `NotifyTradeLatency(totalMs,
  brokerMs)`, called once per fill from `Submit()`. Tracks running
  count/sum/max (not per-sample storage — this runs unattended for
  weeks) for both total and broker-only latency, logs immediately if a
  fill exceeds 3x the running average past the first 5 samples, and adds
  `latency_*` fields to the heartbeat file and `StatusSummary()`.
- **`Execution/OrderManager.mqh`** — `Submit()` reports
  `fsm.TotalLatencyMs()` and `m_broker.LastLatencyMs()` to the monitor
  right after a market-order fill.

### Explicitly not done here
No change to `PlaceLimit`'s waiting-for-fill path (`TS_WAITING`/
`TS_PENDING` for resting orders) — that latency is market-driven (price
reaching the entry zone), not something retry/backoff tuning affects.
Limit-order fills still get their `TS_FILLED` timestamp via
`MarkFilledFromPending()`, which now also reports to
`NotifyTradeLatency()` (with `brokerMs=0.0` — no `CBrokerAdapter` call
happens on that path, MT5 fills the resting order server-side), so the
heartbeat's latency stats cover both fill paths; there's just nothing to
*reduce* on the limit path the way there is on the market-order retry
loop.

## v2.15 — Strategy Selection (fourth and last layer of this batch, diagnostic only)

**This is the final layer added before compiling and forward-testing
v2.12 through v2.15 as one unit** — per explicit agreement to stop here.
Nothing further gets built until that happens.

This is the doc's "four different questions, keep them separate" idea,
specifically implementing its strongest warning: never sum every
strategy's score into one number and call the total a confidence. This
class compares; it never sums.

### Added
- **`Strategies/StrategySelector.mqh`** (facade:
  `includes/StrategySelector.mqh`) — `CStrategySelector` has no engine
  dependencies at all; it only reads values `CRegimeDetector`,
  `CMomentumBreakoutEngine`, `CMeanReversionEngine`, and `CKeyLevelEngine`
  already computed on the same `SetupReasons`, called last in
  `PopulateStrategyDiagnostics()`. Selection rule:
  - The live SMC engine's own `confidence` is always the baseline
    candidate — it's the only strategy actually trading today.
  - Regime picks the ONE challenger compared against it:
    `REGIME_TRENDING` → best of `momentum_score`/`breakout_score`;
    `REGIME_RANGING` → `reversion_score` (unless `reversion_class ==
    REVERSION_TREND_CONFLICT`, in which case no challenger is
    considered at all — the doc's "should not fight a strong trend"
    rule enforced here, not just noted); `REGIME_TRANSITION` →
    `keylevel_score` (unless `keylevel_reaction == REACTION_NONE`);
    `REGIME_UNDEFINED` → no challenger, fail closed.
  - The challenger only wins if it clears `InpMinSelectionScore` AND
    outright beats SMC confidence.
- **Stated plainly, not left implicit**: this is a genuine first-cut
  rule — one challenger per regime compared against the baseline — not
  the doc's full cross-regime free-for-all where every strategy
  competes regardless of regime. It was checked against the doc's own
  worked examples (Market A/B/C) and produces the same winner in each,
  which is why this shape was chosen over a more elaborate one.
- `SetupReasons.selected_strategy` / `selected_strategy_score`
  (`Core/Config.mqh`) — written last, after every other v2.1x field on
  the same struct. Still never read by `CalculateConfidence()`,
  `CDecisionEngine`, or order sizing — recording a selection is not the
  same as acting on it.
- `PopulateStrategyDiagnostics()` signature changed to take `confidence`
  as a parameter (same pattern `PopulateConfidenceDiagnostics()` already
  used) — both call sites in `Trading/TradeZone.mqh` updated to pass
  `setup.confidence`.
- EA input group **"Strategy Selection (v2.15)"**: `InpMinSelectionScore`
  — CSV-only in effect.
- Signals CSV and Outcomes CSV both gain `SelectedStrategy`,
  `SelectedStrategyScore`, appended after the v2.14 columns. Header/row
  argument counts verified to match exactly (46 args including `handle`
  on the Signals write, 48 on the Outcomes write).

### What happens next (not started, by agreement)
Compile v2.12-v2.15 in MetaEditor and forward-test as one unit before
anything further is added. Once that's done: the forward-test harness
that runs every strategy simultaneously (only meaningful with all four
scores populated the way they now are), the numeric-parameter-proposal
engine, and `ingest_tester_csv` remain exactly where the v2.12 entry
left them.

## v2.14 — Key-Level Reaction (strategy module #3, diagnostic only)

Module #3 of the multi-strategy architecture (see v2.12/v2.13 for
modules #1/#2). Same discipline as every `v2.1x` release before it:
nothing here can change a trading decision.

### Added
- **`Strategies/KeyLevelReaction.mqh`** (facade:
  `includes/KeyLevelReaction.mqh`) — `CKeyLevelEngine` finds the nearest
  key level to price across four reused sources (no source-type
  priority — nearest wins):
  - `LEVEL_SR` — `CSupportResistance` zones
  - `LEVEL_ORDER_BLOCK` — `COrderBlock` demand/supply zones (`dir ==
    FVG_BULL`/`FVG_BEAR` picks which side each zone acts on)
  - `LEVEL_VALUE_AREA` — `CValueAreaEngine`'s VAH/VAL
  - `LEVEL_LIQUIDITY_POOL` — `CLiquidity` events flagged `external`,
    which that struct's own comment already defines as "D1 high/low
    sweep" — directly reused as the doc's "previous day high/low"
    rather than recomputed
  Then classifies what price did there, examining the last
  `InpKeyLevelLookbackBars` closed bars: `REACTION_ACCEPTANCE` (2+
  recent closes on the far side — the level flipped role),
  `REACTION_BREAK` (only the latest close is on the far side — fresh,
  unconfirmed), `REACTION_RETEST` (broke earlier in the window, has come
  back without re-crossing), `REACTION_FAILED_BREAK` (broke earlier,
  closed back on the hold side), `REACTION_REJECTION` (touched, closed
  back with a rejection wick through the level), `REACTION_ABSORPTION`
  (repeated touches, no break, no strong wick), `REACTION_NONE` (no
  level in range, or none of the above fit).
- **Honest limit, stated in the file header, not buried**:
  `keylevel_score` is a **fixed per-classification conviction weight**
  (90/75/70/60/65/40/0), not a computed composite like
  `momentum_score`/`breakout_score`/`reversion_score` in v2.12/v2.13.
  The underlying signal here is categorical — "what happened" — and
  forcing a fake continuous score onto it to look consistent with the
  other two modules would misrepresent what's actually being measured.
- `SetupReasons.keylevel_source` / `keylevel_reaction` / `keylevel_score`
  (`Core/Config.mqh`) — always populated, never consulted.
- `CScoringEngine::ConfigureKeyLevelDiagnostics()` — called from the
  same `PopulateStrategyDiagnostics()` as v2.12/v2.13, after the mean
  reversion call.
- EA input group **"Key-Level Reaction Diagnostics (v2.14)"**:
  `InpKeyLevelLookbackBars`, `InpKeyLevelSearchATRMax`,
  `InpKeyLevelTouchToleranceATRMult`, `InpKeyLevelAbsorptionMinTouches`,
  `InpKeyLevelWickRejectionRatio` — CSV-only in effect.
- Signals CSV and Outcomes CSV both gain `KeyLevelSource`,
  `KeyLevelReaction`, `KeyLevelScore`, appended after the v2.13 columns.
  Header/row argument counts verified to match exactly (44 args
  including `handle` on the Signals write, 46 on the Outcomes write).

### Timeframe note (same disclosure pattern as v2.12/v2.13)
Candles/SR/value-area/order-block here are all the chart-TF context
(`m_srCtx`) — self-consistent. Order block reuses that context's OWN
instance (`m_srCtx.orderBlock`), which is a DIFFERENT instance from the
separate genuinely-higher-timeframe one `OBScore()` uses
(`m_htfObCtx.orderBlock`) — this module reads chart-TF order blocks,
not the doc's "HTF support/resistance" in the fully cross-timeframe
sense. Liquidity reuses whichever timeframe `InpLiquidityTF` is
configured to, same cross-timeframe caveat v2.12/v2.13 already carry.

### Explicitly NOT in this release
- **Previous week high/low, session high/low, psychological
  (round-number) levels** — three of the doc's listed level types. None
  of the three exist anywhere in this codebase yet. Building three new
  level detectors in the same pass as the reaction classifier above
  would have meant a much larger surface of unverified logic than this
  repo's discipline accepts.
- **All four strategy modules now exist (SMC baseline + Momentum/
  Breakout + Mean Reversion + Key-Level Reaction). Strategy selection /
  portfolio-level allocation is the natural next step** — deciding which
  module's read matters given the regime — but is still not started.
  Everything else listed as not-in-this-release in v2.12/v2.13 remains
  not-in-this-release: the forward-test harness that runs every strategy
  simultaneously, the numeric-parameter-proposal engine, and
  `ingest_tester_csv`.

## v2.13 — Mean Reversion (strategy module #2, diagnostic only)

Module #2 of the multi-strategy architecture (see v2.12 for module #1
and the reasoning for building one at a time). Nothing in this release
can change a trading decision — same discipline as every `v2.1x`
release before it.

### Added
- **`Strategies/MeanReversion.mqh`** (facade: `includes/MeanReversion.mqh`)
  — `CMeanReversionEngine` scores a fade setup along two paths:
  - `REVERSION_VALUE_FADE` — price stretched beyond a `CValueAreaEngine`
    edge (`VAH()`/`VAL()`) by a configurable ATR multiple, with a
    rejection wick or a confirming `CLiquidity` sweep. The stronger of
    the two paths.
  - `REVERSION_LEVEL_REJECTION` — rejected at a plain `CSupportResistance`
    zone with a rejection wick, no value-area stretch required. Weaker,
    scored lower.
  - `REVERSION_TREND_CONFLICT` — **overrides** either path above: a
    recent opposing `BOSEvent` (reusing `CBOS`'s already-computed
    `strength`, same reuse precedent as v2.12) above a configurable
    threshold means the move being faded is still structurally
    confirmed. Directly implements the spec's explicit warning —
    "mean reversion should not fight a strong trend merely because
    price looks expensive." The score is left as computed rather than
    zeroed, so the CSV shows *why* a setup that looked like a fade was
    flagged risky.
  - `REVERSION_NONE` — neither qualifying path's minimum bar is met.
  "Controlled volatility" is a soft component (adds to the score when
  volatility isn't `VOL_REGIME_HIGH`), not a hard veto — a single
  percentile read shouldn't unilaterally disqualify an otherwise
  well-formed setup.
- Rejection-wick detection reads **shift 1** (the last fully closed
  bar), not shift 0 — same "final, not still-forming" convention as
  `Scoring.mqh`'s existing RVOL check (FIX #16), since a wick on a
  still-printing bar isn't evidence of anything yet.
- `Analysis/Scoring.mqh` gains a **second, chart-TF-scoped
  `CVolatilityRegime` instance** (`m_volRegimeSR`), deliberately separate
  from the BOS-TF instance Momentum/Regime use — value area and SR live
  on the chart timeframe, so "controlled volatility" needs to describe
  that same market, not a possibly-different BOS timeframe.
- `SetupReasons.reversion_score` / `reversion_class` (`Core/Config.mqh`)
  — always populated, never consulted, same convention as every prior
  diagnostic block.
- `CScoringEngine::ConfigureMeanReversionDiagnostics()` — called from the
  same `PopulateStrategyDiagnostics()` used by v2.12, immediately after
  the momentum/breakout call, same "independent scores computed at the
  same call site" pattern.
- EA input group **"Mean Reversion Diagnostics (v2.13)"**:
  `InpReversionMinStretchATR`, `InpReversionSRZoneATRTolerance`,
  `InpReversionWickRejectionRatio`, `InpReversionLiqRecencyBars`,
  `InpReversionTrendConflictRecencyBars`,
  `InpReversionTrendConflictMinStrength` — CSV-only in effect.
- Signals CSV and Outcomes CSV both gain `ReversionScore`,
  `ReversionClass`, appended after the v2.12 columns. Header/row argument
  counts verified to match exactly (41 args including `handle` on the
  Signals write, 43 on the Outcomes write).

### Timeframe note (disclosed, not hidden)
Mean Reversion's candles/SR/value-area come from the chart-TF context
(self-consistent). Its liquidity and BOS reads reuse whichever
timeframes `InpLiquidityTF`/`InpBOSTF` are configured to — the same
cross-timeframe caveat `MomentumBreakout.mqh` already carries from v2.12,
not a new one introduced here.

### Explicitly NOT in this release
- **Key-Level Price Action / Reaction Engine** — strategy module #3, not
  started.
- **Strategy selection / portfolio-level allocation** — still meaningless
  until all planned strategies exist.
- Everything else listed as not-in-this-release in the v2.12 entry below
  remains not-in-this-release: the forward-test harness that runs every
  strategy simultaneously, the numeric-parameter-proposal engine, and
  `ingest_tester_csv` (still blocked on a real CSV export, not on design
  work).

## v2.12 — Regime Detector + Momentum/Breakout (strategy module #1, diagnostic only)

Step one of the multi-strategy architecture: separate regime detection
from a per-strategy score, and separate that score from the SMC engine's
own confidence — as opposed to folding everything into one additive
sum. Nothing in this release can change a trading decision. Both new
engines reuse existing detectors (`CTrendEngine`, `CVolatilityRegime`,
`CMarketPhase`, `CBOS`'s stored `BOSEvent.strength`, `CLiquidity`'s event
list) rather than reimplementing them, and are read only by CSV logging.

### Added
- **`Regime/RegimeDetector.mqh`** (facade: `includes/RegimeDetector.mqh`)
  — `CRegimeDetector` classifies the current bar into `REGIME_TRENDING` /
  `REGIME_RANGING` / `REGIME_TRANSITION` / `REGIME_UNDEFINED` by combining
  `CTrendEngine.GetCurrentTrend()`, `CVolatilityRegime.Classify()` and
  `CMarketPhase.Detect()`. `REGIME_TRANSITION` is the deliberate catch-all
  for everything that isn't a clean trend or a clean range — `CMarketPhase`
  itself already documents its own phase read as a heuristic, not a proven
  detector, and this class inherits that honesty rather than forcing a
  weak signal into a stronger-sounding bucket.
- **`Strategies/MomentumBreakout.mqh`** (facade:
  `includes/MomentumBreakout.mqh`) — `CMomentumBreakoutEngine` scans the
  most recent same-direction `BOSEvent` and classifies it:
  - `BREAKOUT_FAILED` — price has since closed back on the wrong side of
    the broken level (checked first; overrides every other label).
  - `BREAKOUT_LIQUIDITY` — the BOS bar coincides with a liquidity-sweep
    event (`CLiquidity`'s own event list) — overlaps the SMC engine by
    design, per the spec this module is built from.
  - `BREAKOUT_EXHAUSTION` — price was already extended, in ATR, over the
    configured lookback *before* the break bar — "do not chase", per the
    spec, not a green light despite a strong displacement score.
  - `BREAKOUT_EXPANSION` — none of the above: fresh, displacement-and-
    volume backed (reuses `BOSEvent.strength`, already computed by
    `CBOS::Detect()`), not sweep-driven, not already extended.
  - `BREAKOUT_NONE` — no BOS in the setup direction within the recency
    window.
  Also produces an independent `momentum_score` (net directional
  close-to-close movement over a configurable window, scaled by that
  window's own average ATR) — a plain rate-of-change-over-volatility
  heuristic, stated as such rather than oversold as a proprietary
  indicator.
- `SetupReasons.regime` / `momentum_score` / `breakout_score` /
  `breakout_class` (`Core/Config.mqh`) — always populated, never
  consulted, same convention as the v2.10 diagnostic block.
- `CScoringEngine::ConfigureStrategyDiagnostics()` /
  `PopulateStrategyDiagnostics()` (`Analysis/Scoring.mqh`) — owns both new
  engines as members (everything they need — `m_trendCtx.trend`,
  `m_bosCtx.bos`, `m_liqCtx.liquidity`, `m_phase`, `m_volRegime` — already
  existed on this class, so no new object graph was needed at the `.mq5`
  level). Called from `Trading/TradeZone.mqh`'s `GenerateBuySetup()`/
  `GenerateSellSetup()` immediately after `PopulateConfidenceDiagnostics()`,
  same "deliberately after, never feeds back" placement as v2.10.
- EA input group **"Strategy Diagnostics (v2.12)"**:
  `InpMomentumBreakoutRecencyBars`, `InpBreakoutLiqOverlapBars`,
  `InpBreakoutExtensionLookbackBars`, `InpBreakoutExhaustionATRMult`,
  `InpMomentumLookbackBars` — all CSV-only in effect, defaults are
  starting points from the spec's own reasoning, not tuned constants.
- Signals CSV and Outcomes CSV both gain `Regime`, `MomentumScore`,
  `BreakoutScore`, `BreakoutClass`. Columns are **appended**, so
  position-based parsers keep working — header/row argument counts
  verified to match exactly (39 args including `handle` on the Signals
  write, 41 on the Outcomes write).

### Explicitly NOT in this release
- **Mean Reversion** and the **Key-Level Price Action / Reaction Engine**
  — the next two strategy modules in the architecture this doc follows.
  Not started. Building four untested MQL5 modules in one pass, with no
  compiler available in this environment, would have meant a much larger
  surface of unverified logic than this repo's existing discipline
  accepts (see `tools/walk_forward.py`'s `ingest_tester_csv` stub for the
  same reasoning applied elsewhere).
- **Strategy selection / portfolio-level allocation** — meaningless until
  more than one strategy exists to select between.
- **Forward-test harness that runs every strategy simultaneously** — the
  literal ask from the architecture doc requires the strategies above to
  exist first. What exists today that's adjacent to it: v2.10's additive
  vs. multiplicative confidence models are already logged side by side,
  unread by anything — that pairing could be shadow-scored today without
  waiting on Mean Reversion / Price Action.
- **Numeric-parameter-proposal engine** — `ConfigResponse.params` in the
  telegram-bridge is still always `null`; still nothing correct to
  compute for it yet.
- **`ingest_tester_csv`** — still an intentional `NotImplementedError`;
  still blocked on one real Strategy Tester CSV export, not on more
  design work.

## v2.10 — Confidence Engine Upgrade (diagnostic only)

Nothing in this release can change a trading decision. Every number added is
computed, logged, and read by no filter, no confidence value, no lot size and
no order — so the alternative model can be measured against the live one on
real resolved outcomes before it is trusted with money.

### Added
- `SetupReasons.contradiction_penalty` — counts only *actively opposing*
  conditions, so "no HTF read" stops costing the same as "fighting the HTF".
- `SetupReasons.env_score` / `exec_score` / `env_exec_confidence` — the
  multiplicative model: `Confidence x Env x Exec x (1 - Contradiction)`.
  Expresses "unsuitable market" in a way adding points cannot.
- `PendingSetup.confidenceAtSignal` / `confidenceDecayed` / `decayBars` —
  exponential half-life decay applied per **unfilled** bar and frozen at
  fill; a score is only true of the bar that produced it.
- `CScoringEngine::ConfigureLearnedDiagnostics()` and
  `COutcomeTracker::ConfigureConfidenceDecay()`.
- EA input group "Confidence Diagnostics (v2.10)":
  `InpDiagContradictionWeight`, `InpDiagEnvWeight`, `InpDiagExecWeight`,
  `InpDiagDecayHalfLifeBars` — all CSV-only in effect.
- `tools/medistouch_retrain.py` — offline AUC comparison of the additive vs.
  multiplicative vs. decayed score, with per-component correlation against
  realized R. Read-only; refuses a verdict below `--min-sample` trades.

### Changed
- Signals CSV gains `ContradictionPenalty`, `EnvScore`, `ExecScore`,
  `EnvExecConfidence`. Outcomes CSV gains those plus `ConfidenceAtSignal`,
  `ConfidenceDecayed`, `DecayBars`. Columns are **appended**, so
  position-based parsers keep working.

### Unchanged (deliberately)
- `CalculateConfidence()`'s return value, every entry filter, the
  news/session/sweep gates, sizing, and order placement. Promoting the
  multiplicative model is a future, explicit edit to `Analysis/Scoring.mqh`,
  justified by out-of-sample evidence from the script above.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **`telegram-bridge/` — real copy-trading + payments pipeline (bridge v1.6.0).**
  Previously this only existed in a separate design-scaffold repo; it's now built
  against the real `telegram-bridge/` codebase:
  - `app/subscriptions.py`, `app/models.py` (`Subscriber`, `Payment`) — Telegram
    Payments (`sendInvoice`/`successful_payment`, Stars by default, no external
    merchant account) via `app/payments_bot.py`'s `/subscribe`, `/mysubscription`.
    Idempotent on `telegram_payment_charge_id`; early renewals stack remaining
    time rather than discarding it.
  - `app/copy_trading.py`, `GET /copy/feed` (`app/routes.py`) — a paying
    subscriber's own copier script polls this (their own broker account; this
    service never places a trade) with a per-subscriber `X-Copy-Key`, gated on
    both a global admin switch and that subscriber's live entitlement.
    **Load-bearing invariant, checked by tests/test_copy_trading.py:** nothing
    in `POST /signal`'s call graph reaches this module — signal
    generation/ingestion/broadcast is unaffected by copy trading being on or off.
  - `app/copytrading_admin.py` — `/copytrading on|off|status`. Turning it ON
    requires the literal text "yes" from the same admin within
    `COPY_TRADING_CONFIRM_TTL_SECONDS` (`app/settings_store.py`'s
    `request_copy_trading_on`/`confirm_copy_trading_on`); turning it OFF is
    immediate, no confirmation — the safe direction shouldn't have friction.
  - `app/group_enforcement.py`, `POST /admin/check-subscriptions` — warns
    subscribers nearing expiry, transitions lapsed periods to `EXPIRED`, and
    after `SUBSCRIPTION_GRACE_PERIOD_DAYS` removes them from `GROUP_CHAT_ID`
    (ban+immediate-unban — Telegram's kick pattern, so they can rejoin after
    paying) via `/checkpayments` or the new
    `.github/workflows/daily-subscription-check.yml` cron.
  - Migration `0007_subscribers_and_payments.py` (plain String status columns,
    not PG_ENUM — same call as `promotion_requests.status` in 0006, for the
    same reason).
  - 33 new tests (subscriptions, copy_trading, group_enforcement,
    copytrading_admin, payments_bot, copy-feed routes); 125/125 total pass.
    ruff clean, bandit zero issues.

### Added
- **`telegram-bridge/` — 10 new admin Telegram commands (bridge v1.4.0).**
  `/stats`, `/symbols`, `/status`, `/mute`, `/unmute`, `/muted`, `/pause`,
  `/resume`, `/retry`, `/version`. Backed by a new `bot_settings` key/value
  table (migration `0003_bot_settings_table.py`, `app/settings_store.py`)
  that persists mute/pause state across Render redeploys. `POST /signal`
  now checks this state before contacting Telegram: a muted symbol or a
  global pause suppresses the broadcast but still records the `Signal` row
  (status `ACTIVE`, `telegram_message_id` left null) so `/stats` and win-rate
  history stay accurate. `/retry` reuses the exact same retry logic as the
  `/retry-failed` and `/trade/retry-failed` HTTP endpoints (both refactored
  into `retry_failed_signals_core()` / `retry_failed_trade_events_core()`
  in `app/routes.py` so there's one implementation, not two).

- **`EA/` — MedisTouch v2.8 MQL5 source is now in the repository.**
  `EA/MedisTouch_v2.8.mq5` (Expert Advisor), `EA/MedisTouch_Indicator_v2.8.mq5`
  (visuals-only chart indicator, since MQL5 forbids trading calls from an
  indicator context) and the full engine under `EA/includes/`. Three facade
  headers expose the v2.8 additions at stable include paths:
  `includes/InducementEngine.mqh`, `includes/HTF_OrderBlock.mqh`,
  `includes/VolatilityRegime.mqh`.
- **`Decision/` layer completed.** The tree referenced
  `Decision/DecisionEngine.mqh` and `Decision/TradeDecision.mqh` which did not
  exist, and `Decision/DecisionStore.mqh` was committed empty — the EA could
  not compile at all. Now implemented:
  - `TradeDecision.mqh` — `TradeDecisionRecord`, `ExecutionRecord` and
    `ENUM_TRADE_POLICY` (`IGNORE`/`SIGNAL_ONLY`/`EXECUTE_ONLY`/`EXECUTE_AND_SIGNAL`),
    shared by the router, order manager, publisher and store so all four act on
    one immutable record.
  - `DecisionEngine.mqh` — policy router: confidence thresholds per channel,
    an execution-only spread gate (a wide spread ruins the fill, it does not
    invalidate the analysis, so subscribers still get the signal),
    `reduce_risk` below `InpFullRiskConfidence`, and monotonic decision IDs
    with `SeedNextId()` so a restarted terminal never reissues an ID already
    baked into a broker order comment.
  - `DecisionStore.mqh` — append-only CSV persistence in `MQL5/Files`
    (`MedisTouch_Decisions_<SYMBOL>.csv`, `MedisTouch_Executions_<SYMBOL>.csv`)
    with an in-memory mirror, idempotent saves, and a flush+close per write so
    a decision is durable before the order that follows it can fill. This is
    the half of the state `RecoveryEngine` cannot get from the broker.
- **Root `.gitignore`** covering compiled MQL5 output (`*.ex5`, `*.ex4`),
  Python/pytest/ruff caches, local SQLite files and `.env` (with
  `.env.example` kept).
- **`ea-validate` CI workflow** (`tools/validate_mql5.py`). MetaEditor is
  Windows-only, so CI does a structural check instead of a compile: every
  `#include` must resolve (case-sensitively), no header may be empty, include
  guards must balance, and no compiled binary may be committed.

### Changed
- **`ADMIN_CHAT_ID` split out from `CHAT_ID`.** `CHAT_ID` is now purely the
  outbound broadcast destination (the signal group), while the inbound bot
  accepts commands (`/positions`, `/risk`, ...) only from `ADMIN_CHAT_ID` —
  normally your personal DM. Previously anyone in the signal group could
  query live positions and P/L. `ADMIN_CHAT_ID` is required at startup, the
  same treatment as `BOT_TOKEN`; set it in Render (or `.env`) before
  deploying, and add it as a repository secret for the Render sync workflow.
  The `ADMIN_CHAT_ID` repository secret is configured, so
  `.github/workflows/render-secrets.yml` can push it to Render; the value is
  never committed.


## [1.3.0] — POST /trade, Render blueprint fixes, dependency refresh

### Added
- **`POST /trade`** and **`POST /trade/retry-failed`** — new trade lifecycle
  event endpoint, distinct from `/signal`. A `Signal` is a pre-trade alert
  with no guarantee an order was ever opened; a `TradeEvent` is reported by
  the EA's `OrderManager`/`PositionManager` *after* it actually placed,
  modified, or closed a real order. Backed by a new `trade_events` table
  (migration `0002`) with its own idempotency key (`event_id`, not
  `trade_id` — the same `trade_id` legitimately recurs across
  `opened → partial_close → closed_tp1`). Same PENDING-row-reservation
  pattern as `/signal` to prevent double-sends under concurrent
  WebRequest retries from the EA. See `README.md` for the payload shape.
- `validate_trade_event()` in `validator.py` — lighter than
  `validate_signal()`: SL/TP are optional since close events legitimately
  omit them once the position is flat.

### Fixed
- **Root cause of the recurring Render Blueprint deploy failure** identified
  and documented in `render.yaml`/`Dockerfile`: the container's first
  command (`alembic upgrade head`) imports `app.config`, which raises a
  `pydantic.ValidationError` and exits non-zero if `BOT_TOKEN`/`CHAT_ID`/
  `SECRET_KEY` aren't set — and Blueprint sync creates those slots
  (`sync: false`) without populating them, so a fresh deploy could never
  reach a healthy state without a manual dashboard step. Dockerfile `CMD`
  now checks for this up front and fails with a readable message instead
  of a raw traceback buried in `alembic`'s output.
- Removed non-existent top-level `version:` key from `render.yaml` (not
  part of Render's Blueprint schema — services/databases/envVarGroups/
  projects/ungrouped/previews are the only root keys).
- `env: docker` → `runtime: docker` (the `env` key for specifying the
  runtime is deprecated in Render's current Blueprint spec; still accepted
  today but shouldn't be relied on).
- Removed a factually incorrect comment in `Dockerfile` claiming
  `dockerContext` is "not supported in render.yaml" — it is a valid,
  documented field, and it's exactly what `render.yaml` already relies on
  to make the `COPY telegram-bridge/...` paths resolve.
- Added explicit `healthCheckPath: /` to `render.yaml`.
- `pydantic-settings` bumped `2.1.0` → `2.14.2` and `httpx` bumped
  `0.26.0` → `0.28.1` — both were roughly two years stale relative to the
  `fastapi==0.140.0` pin they shipped alongside, an accident waiting to
  surface as a transitive resolver conflict on some future rebuild.
  `asyncpg` bumped `0.29.0` → `0.31.0` for the same reason.

### Docs
- `README.md`: documented the free-tier Render Postgres 30-day hard expiry
  — it is **not** an inactivity timer, so logging into the dashboard does
  not delay or prevent it (only the free *web service*'s 15-minute
  spin-down is activity-based, and pinging the dashboard doesn't touch
  that either — only real traffic to the service does).
- `README.md`: documented the required manual secrets step in the Render
  deployment section, and added the `/trade` endpoint to the API table
  and payload examples.

## [1.2.0] — race-condition fix, packaging, migrations, docs honesty

### Fixed
- **Duplicate-send race closed.** `POST /signal` previously ran the
  Telegram send *before* the DB insert that provides duplicate protection,
  so two concurrent requests for the same `signal_id` could both pass the
  pre-check and both call Telegram - only one row would survive the unique
  constraint, but two messages could already be sent. Now the row is
  inserted as `PENDING` first (reserving `signal_id` via the unique
  constraint) and only the request that wins the insert proceeds to call
  Telegram, so the external call happens at most once per `signal_id`.
- `/retry-failed` now also reclaims signals stuck at `PENDING` for longer
  than `PENDING_STALE_SECONDS` (default 120s) - closes the gap where a
  process crash/restart between reserving `signal_id` and resolving the
  Telegram send left a row with no path back to `ACTIVE`/`FAILED`.
- Root `README.md` no longer claims the MQL5 EA source exists in
  `mql5/Experts/MedisTouch/`. It doesn't yet. Added a `Status` section and
  per-folder placeholder `README.md` files so the directory tree matches
  reality instead of describing a future state as if it were current.

### Fixed (security)
- `fastapi` bumped `0.109.0` → `0.140.0` (pulls `starlette` `1.3.1`). The
  previous pins carried 8 disclosed vulnerabilities (`PYSEC-2024-38` and
  7 `starlette` CVEs) that `bandit`'s code-pattern scanning would never
  have caught - only `pip-audit` (added in this release, see below)
  surfaces known-CVE-in-a-pinned-version issues. Full test suite re-run
  and green at the new pins.

### Changed
- `requirements.txt` no longer installs `pytest`/`pytest-asyncio` into the
  production Docker image. Test/lint tooling moved to
  `requirements-dev.txt` (and mirrored in `pyproject.toml`'s
  `[project.optional-dependencies].dev`).
- CI now installs `requirements-dev.txt` and runs `pip-audit` against
  `requirements.txt` - bandit catches risky code patterns, not known CVEs
  in pinned dependency versions, so this closes that gap.

### Added
- Alembic migrations (`migrations/`), with an initial revision (`0001`)
  matching the schema `Base.metadata.create_all()` previously created
  implicitly at startup. `init_db()` remains for local/test convenience
  only; production schema changes now go through `alembic upgrade head`
  instead of an implicit, un-versioned `create_all()`.

## [1.1.0] — telegram-bridge rewrite

### Added
- `SignalStatus.PERMANENTLY_FAILED` — signals that hit a `NonRetryableError` are
  marked with this status so `/retry-failed` never re-selects them.
- `MaxBodySizeMiddleware` — raw ASGI middleware enforces the body-size cap against
  both `Content-Length` (cheap path) and actual streamed bytes (handles chunked
  transfer and lying clients).
- Index on `Signal.status` to keep `/retry-failed`'s `WHERE status = 'failed'`
  query fast as the table grows.
- `check_bot_token()` called at startup; logs a warning rather than crashing if
  the token is invalid, so the process still starts and the ops team can fix the
  secret without a full redeploy.
- Structured logging extras now rendered — `logger.bind(signal_id=...)` values
  actually appear in log output after fixing the format string.
- `TELEGRAM_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`, `TELEGRAM_MAX_RETRIES`, `TELEGRAM_RETRY_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS`
  config knobs with sensible defaults; worst-case retry window is now bounded and
  documented for the EA's WebRequest timeout budget.

### Changed
- Rate limiter rewritten from scratch (`app/ratelimit.py`) — dropped `slowapi`
  (maintenance concern; the `@limiter.limit(... if enabled else None)` pattern
  raises at import time when the limiter is disabled). Replaced with an
  in-memory fixed-window limiter that uses `X-Forwarded-For` for client
  identification (Render terminates TLS and `request.client.host` alone would
  collapse every caller into one bucket).
- CORS only applied when `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` lists explicit origins. The previous
  `allow_origins=["*"] + allow_credentials=True` combination is rejected by
  browsers per spec.
- API key comparison is now timing-safe (`secrets.compare_digest`).
- Shared `httpx.AsyncClient` created at startup and reused across all Telegram
  calls — avoids a fresh TCP+TLS handshake per signal.
- `@app.on_event("startup")` replaced with a `lifespan` context manager
  (the event-hook API is deprecated in current FastAPI).
- `payload.dict()` (Pydantic v1, deprecated) replaced with `payload.model_dump()`.
- `config.py` migrated from `class Config:` to `SettingsConfigDict` (Pydantic v2).
- Telegram `parse_mode` field omitted from the API payload (previously set to
  `null`, which is a no-op but noisy).

### Fixed
- Duplicate-insert race condition — two concurrent requests for the same
  `signal_id` could both pass the pre-check `SELECT` and one would raise an
  unhandled `IntegrityError` (500). Now caught explicitly; session is rolled
  back and the caller receives a clean duplicate response.
- TP1/TP2 validation added to `validator.py` — previously only stop-loss
  side-of-entry was checked. Now TP1 and TP2 must be on the correct side of
  entry and TP2 must be farther from entry than TP1.
- `entry`, `sl`, `tp1`, `tp2` fields now have `gt=0` Pydantic constraints.

---

## [1.0.0] — initial telegram-bridge

- Basic FastAPI service with `/signal`, `/health/db`, and `/retry-failed`.
- SQLAlchemy async + PostgreSQL persistence.
- `slowapi`-based rate limiting (superseded in 1.1.0).
- Pydantic v1 style settings and model helpers.
