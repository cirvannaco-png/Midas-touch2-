# EA — MedisTouch v2.8 (MQL5)

MetaTrader 5 source for the Medis Touch engine. The backend that receives
its signals lives in [`../telegram-bridge`](../telegram-bridge).

The three facade headers are the stable include paths for the v2.8
additions. They only `#include` the real implementation next to the
concepts it depends on, so the internal folder layout can move without
breaking call sites. Every underlying header has an include guard, so
including a facade and the concrete header together is safe.

## Why two `.mq5` files

MQL5 forbids trading calls (`OrderSend`, `CTrade`) from an indicator
context. `MedisTouch_Indicator_v2.8.mq5` is the visualisation-only chart
indicator; `MedisTouch_v2.8.mq5` is the robot that runs under `OnTick()`
where trading is legal. They share the same analysis engine and can run
on the same chart together.

## Install / compile

1. Copy `MedisTouch_v2.8.mq5` and the whole `includes/` folder into
   `MQL5/Experts/MedisTouch/` in your terminal's data folder
   (File → Open Data Folder in MT5), keeping the relative layout —
   the EA includes with paths like `includes/Core/Config.mqh`.
2. Copy `MedisTouch_Indicator_v2.8.mq5` (plus the same `includes/`) into
   `MQL5/Indicators/MedisTouch/` if you want the chart visuals.
3. Open each `.mq5` in MetaEditor and press F7. Expect 0 errors.
4. In MT5: Tools → Options → Expert Advisors → allow WebRequest for the
   backend URL, otherwise `SignalPublisher` cannot post signals.

Compiled `.ex5` output is git-ignored on purpose — build it locally.

## Multi-symbol

Nothing in the engine is XAUUSD-specific: pip/point sizing
(`Core/PipCalculator.mqh`) is derived from broker symbol properties, and
the volatility regime classifier (`Analysis/VolatilityRegime.mqh`) is
ATR-percentile-based against each symbol's own history, not a hardcoded
absolute threshold. Trading EURUSD, USDJPY, or EURGBP alongside XAUUSD
means attaching another instance of `MedisTouch_v2.8.mq5` to that
symbol's chart with its own `InpWeightSetVersion` — MT5 runs one EA
instance per chart/symbol by design, this isn't a single process
handling multiple symbols. Every instance posts to the same bridge;
`signals`/`signal_outcomes` already carry `symbol` as a first-class
column, so `tools/metrics_engine.py --regime-matrix` and
`tools/calibration_matrix.py` break down by symbol automatically once
more than one is live.

## Signal publishing

`Signals/SignalPublisher.mqh` posts each routed decision to the FastAPI
service in `telegram-bridge`. The service broadcasts to `CHAT_ID` and
accepts bot commands only from `ADMIN_CHAT_ID`.

Each signal is tagged with `regime`, `session`, `sweep_grade`,
`htf_ob_aligned`, and `weight_version` (the `InpWeightSetVersion` input —
bump this by hand whenever a scoring-formula change ships; nothing
enforces it yet). `Trading/OutcomeTracker.mqh` posts the matching
resolved outcome (win/loss/scratch/no_fill/ambiguous, realized R,
MFE/MAE) to `POST /outcome` the moment it resolves a setup, via the same
`decision_id` the signal was published under — see that file's
`PublishIfConfigured()` and `Config.mqh`'s `PendingSetup.decisionId` for
why `AddSetup()` has to happen *after* `CDecisionRouter::Decide()` mints
that id, not before.

`Signals/ConfigSync.mqh` (opt-in via `InpConfigSyncEndpoint`, blank by
default) polls `GET /config/{symbol}` on a timer (`InpConfigSyncPollMinutes`)
and warns in the terminal log if the bridge's most-recently-approved
weight_version differs from this instance's compiled `InpWeightSetVersion`.
It never changes behavior automatically — see `telegram-bridge/README.md`'s
"Trade tagging & recalibration" section for why nothing can yet.

## Decision persistence

`Decision/DecisionStore.mqh` appends every routed decision and every
submitted execution to CSV files in the terminal's `MQL5/Files` folder
(`MedisTouch_Decisions_<SYMBOL>.csv`, `MedisTouch_Executions_<SYMBOL>.csv`).
`Recovery/RecoveryEngine.mqh` reads them at startup and matches broker
tickets back to the setup that created them via the `MT#<decision_id>`
order comment. Deleting those files means a restarted terminal can no
longer manage trades opened by a previous session.

## CI

`.gitlab-ci.yml` runs `tools/validate_mql5.py` on every
change under `EA/`: it resolves every `#include` in the tree, fails on a
missing or case-mismatched header, on unbalanced include guards, and on
any compiled binary (`*.ex5`/`*.ex4`) that slipped into the repository.
MetaEditor is Windows-only and not available in the Linux CI runner, so this is
a static structural check, not a compile.
